                Nutrition is very important at every stage. Fresh food is cooked everyday for the
                 students who are unable to bring tiffin from their home. Our canteen is certified
                  by FDA. Dal-rice is the favourite food of all the students which is served hot 
                  in the recess time. The food quality and hygiene is regularly checked before it 
                  is served to the students. We also practice organic farming on a small scale so 
                  that we can regularly provide fresh agricultural vegetables. How and what a child
                   eats today can have a huge impact on their adolescence and adulthood.
